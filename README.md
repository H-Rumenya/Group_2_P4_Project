## ðŸ“„ Project Description

In todayâ€™s crowded streaming landscape, users face decision fatigue due to the overwhelming number of available titles. This often leads to reduced watch time and increased churn. To address this, the project aims to build a personalized movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. By analyzing user ratings and preferences, the system will deliver the top five movie suggestions tailored to individual tastes.

The goal is to enhance user satisfaction and retention by surfacing relevant content that resonates with each viewer. This solution will serve key stakeholders including:

- ðŸŽ¯ Product Team
- ðŸ“Š Data Scientists
- ðŸ“£ Marketing Teams
- ðŸŽ¥ Streaming Platform Owners

The recommendation engine will leverage collaborative filtering techniques to uncover latent user preferences. Success will be measured through:

- âœ… **RMSE/MAE** â€“ for rating prediction accuracy
- âœ… **Precision, Recall, F1 Score** â€“ for ranking quality
- âœ… **Coverage & Diversity** â€“ for recommendation variety and system robustness
- âœ… **User Engagement Metrics** â€“ to assess impact on satisfaction and retention
- âœ… **Actionable Insights** â€“ for product and marketing teams
- âœ… **Visualizations** â€“ to communicate results to non-technical stakeholders

The central question guiding this project is:

> **"How can we deliver personalized movie recommendations that will ultimately increase user satisfaction and retention on a streaming platform?"**


## Data Understanding
The project used the dataset, comprising four CSV files: 
- **links.csv**
- **movies.csv**
- **ratings.csv**
- **tags.csv**

 offers a comprehensive foundation for a robust movie recommendation system.
